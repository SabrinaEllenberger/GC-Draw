# GC-Draw

GC-Draw visualizes the GC content of a mitochondrial DNA as a circular and a linear diagram.
The linear diagram shows the minimal, average and maximal GC content of the presented mtDNA.
Yellow parts show GC content, which is lower than the average GC content.
Red parts show the GC content, which is higher than the average GC content.
The diagrams can be saved as .jpg files.
The directory "mtDNA-Zygomycetes" contains the circular and linear diagrams of the zygomycetes considered in the paper of Ellenberger, S., Burmester, A. and WÃ¶stemeyer, J. (2016).
